# NES_Emulator
This is a Nintendo NES Emulator based on 6502 CPU architecture. It is constructed using YouTube tutorial series on building NES Emulator by javidx9, which I'm whole-heartedly grateful too.

Here is the playlist I followed:

Also, I used his source code to copy Address mode functions and opcode functions.
Here is his original authentic git repository:

I'm not the original author of this project, but this project helped me understand the components and working of architecture of a CPU and helped me understanding the Emulation technology not to say build one, of which I'm greatly indebted to.

I once again thanks javidx9 for his hard work and give credit to him.
